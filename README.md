# BU-romi32U4-RPi-robot
<h1>Code for Raspberry Pi mounted on Romi 32U4</h1>
<p>
An I2C connection is made between a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and a Romi 32U4. A slave library along with a C++ code is uploaded to the Romi 32U4 giving access of certain components on the Romi to the Raspberry Pi. The slave library and coresponding commands for the Raspberry Pi were taken from the pololu-rpi-slave-arduino-library: https://github.com/pololu/pololu-rpi-slave-arduino-library
